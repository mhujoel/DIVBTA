# Large samples (250 per trial arm) and data duplication: 
Twenty percent data duplications leads to 50% chance for a statistically significant LnCVR.  The probability of detecting statistically significant LnCVR outliers as a result of data duplication remains essentially zero.

# Small samples (20 per trial arm) and data duplication: 
Data duplications in small samples does not lead to statistically significant LnCVRs or statistically significant LnCVR outliers.
